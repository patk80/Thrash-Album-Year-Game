# Thrash Album Year Game
**Languages:** HTML / CSS / JavaScript

**URL:** https://patk80.github.io/Thrash-Album-Year-Game/

**Description:** A browser game I created where the objective is to correctly guess the year that certain thrash metal albums were released. With this project, I wanted to challenge myself to create a game using JavaScript. This involved JS objects, arrays, various methods, DOM manipulation, conditionals, functions, and more.
